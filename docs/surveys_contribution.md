# Contribution Guide: Surveys

If you want to do some evaluation, the DuckDebugger has built-in support recording answers (both single/multiple-choice and freeform text)

See `barebones_js/surveys.yaml` to see how that's structured.

If developing, navigate to [http://127.0.0.1:5000/survey/3e03d6def7ff/4916e066e7fc]([http://127.0.0.1:5000/survey/3e03d6def7ff/4916e066e7fc) to see how the first survey looks like.

Answers are stored in the `response` table in `reviews.db`
